# Hardhat Simple Storage

This project is a basic Solidity + Hardhat setup that demonstrates how to deploy, interact with, and test a simple smart contract. It follows the typical Web3 development workflow and is designed for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of smart contracts and deployment using Hardhat.

## 📦 Project Overview

This sub-folder contains:
- `SimpleStorage.sol` — A basic Solidity contract that stores and retrieves a number.
- Deployment scripts using Hardhat + Ethers.js.
- Local testing environment using Hardhat.
- ABI and binary files generated from the smart contract.
- Configuration files for Hardhat, Prettier, and TypeScript (if enabled).

The purpose of this project is to help developers understand:
- How smart contracts compile
- How ABI & bytecode work
- How to perform local deployment
- How to interact with the contract using scripts
- How to run automated tests
