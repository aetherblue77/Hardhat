# Ethers Simple Storage

This project demonstrates how to deploy and interact with a Solidity smart contract using **pure Ethers.js** without Hardhat. It is designed as a learning exercise to understand the low-level workflow of:

- Loading a wallet
- Connecting to an RPC provider
- Using ABI + Bytecode
- Deploying a contract manually
- Sending transactions and reading state

If you're learning Web3 fundamentals, this folder helps you understand what usually happens "behind the scenes" in frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry.
