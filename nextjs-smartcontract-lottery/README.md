# Next.js Smart Contract Lottery
This is a Next.js project that uses the Moralis to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Create frontend for a Lottery Smart Contract with Next.js and React Web3 / React Moralis. Use Web3Uikit and Tailwind for styling the frontend. I use Metamask as a wallet to interact with the smart contract.

# Hosting
I learn to use Vercel to host my Next.js Smart Contract Lottery project.

# Notes
This code is just for the Smart Contract Lottery Frontend. You have to look and see github repository for the Smart Contract Lottery Backend at the hardhat-smartcontract-lottery repository. Thank you.
